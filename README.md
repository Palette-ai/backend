To run a local copy of the backend: 
* Ensure that you have ran `yarn` to download the latest dependencies before trying to start a local copy of the backend.
* Run `yarn dev` in the console
* Running a local copy of the backend will require several environment variables which we have not deployed to GitHub. If you need help with this then please reach out to us at: palette.dartmouth@gmail.com
